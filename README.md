# House-Price-predictions


This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning. It involves cleaning and preprocessing housing data, handling missing values and outliers, and performing feature engineering such as extracting BHK (bedrooms) from text fields. The model is trained using Linear Regression and evaluated through cross-validation. Key features like location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and bedrooms are used to estimate property prices. The project includes a custom prediction function and various data visualizations to explore trends. Built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, this notebook demonstrates an end-to-end regression pipeline for real estate price prediction.
